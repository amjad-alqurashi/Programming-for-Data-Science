### Date created
28 Dec 2022.

### Project Title
Explore-US-Bikeshare-Data-project

### Description
Overview
In this project, you will make use of Python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United Statesâ€”Chicago, New York City, and Washington. You will write code to import the data and answer interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics. You will also write a script that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.

What Software Do I Need?
To complete this project, i'll require the following softwares:

Python A text editor, like Sublime or Atom A terminal application

Bike Share Data
Over the past decade, bicycle-sharing systems have been growing in number and popularity in cities across the world. Bicycle-sharing systems allow users to rent bicycles on a very short-term basis for a price. This allows people to borrow a bike from point A and return it at point B, though they can also return it to the same location if they'd like to just go for a ride. Regardless, each bike can serve several users per day.

Thanks to the rise in information technologies, it is easy for a user of the system to access a dock within the system to unlock or return bicycles. These technologies also provide a wealth of data that can be used to explore how these bike-sharing systems are used.

In this project, you will use data provided by Motivate, a bike share system provider for many major cities in the United States, to uncover bike share usage patterns. You will compare the system usage between three large cities: Chicago, New York City, and Washington, DC.

The Datasets
The datasets provided by Motivate, a bike share system provider in the US, contains randomly selected data for the first six months of 2017 for all three cities. The data files for all three cities contain the same core six columns:

Start Time End Time Trip Duration Start Station End Station User Type The Chicago and New York City files also have the following two columns:

Gender Birth Year

Statistics Computed
You will learn about bike share use in Chicago, New York City, and Washington by computing a variety of descriptive statistics. In this project, you'll write code to provide the following information:

#1 Popular times of travel (i.e., occurs most often in the start time)

most common month most common day of week most common hour of day #2 Popular stations and trip

most common start station most common end station most common trip from start to end (i.e., most frequent combination of start station and end station) #3 Trip duration

total travel time average travel time #4 User info

counts of each user type counts of each gender (only available for NYC and Chicago) earliest, most recent, most common year of birth (only available for NYC and Chicago)
